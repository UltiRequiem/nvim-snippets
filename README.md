# nvim-snippets

This was originally included in my personal [Neovim setup](https://github.com/UltiRequiem/UltiVim),
but I didn't like having all the snippets there so I decided to have them separately.
This is quite convenient since I can install them like any other plugin now.

## Install
The best way to install this is with your favorite plugin manager for Vim, such as [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug):
```viml
Plug 'UltiRequiem/vim-snippets'
```
